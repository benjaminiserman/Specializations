The Specializations mod for Terraria

I'm adding this readme file like, four years after I actually made this mod.
So basically, this mod just fills out some gaps in Terraria's item system, nothing crazy.

I wrote this back when I was still learning C#, so I'm mostly just working off of tutorials, I didn't really understand the language at that point.
I've updated the code style to match my current style where possible, however I didn't change single-line methods to be expression-bodied because I don't remember which version of C# the engine uses and I didn't want to break it.

Built With:
 - tModLoader
 - XNA Framework
